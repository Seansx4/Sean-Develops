        I am an enthusiastic web developer who enjoys creating brochure websites
        and working on ecommerce related projects. I believe the approach I
        take, and the platforms I use, allow me to minimise costs for businesses
        that I reach out to :)

      <p>
        I film and edit custom drone promotional videos for small businesses.
        Using drone footage for business marketing helps to stand out of the
        crowd and look professional. Intriguing angles always ensure high
        customer engagement.

      <p>
        Brochure websites are exactly that, a brochure. These lightweight
        websites are ideal for providing local businesses with a web presence.
        Consumers are returning to favouring websites over downloadable apps or
        social media profiles, meaning a web presence is more important than
        ever. According to a
        <a
          href="https://themeisle.com/blog/do-i-need-a-website-for-my-business/"
          target="_blank"
          class="underline effect"
          >recent survey</a
        >, 84% of today's consumers think a business with a website is more
        credible than a business with only a social media profile. For more
