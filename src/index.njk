        I am an enthusiastic web developer who enjoys creating brochure websites
        and working on ecommerce related projects. I believe the approach I
        take, and the platforms I use, allow me to minimise costs for businesses
        that I reach out to :)

      <p>
        Brochure websites are exactly that, a brochure. These lightweight
        websites are ideal for providing local businesses with a web presence.
        Consumers are returning to favouring websites over downloadable apps or
        social media profiles, meaning a web presence is more important than
        ever. According to a
        <a
          href="https://themeisle.com/blog/do-i-need-a-website-for-my-business/"
          target="_blank"
          class="underline effect"
          >recent survey</a
        >, 84% of today's consumers think a business with a website is more
        credible than a business with only a social media profile. For more
        information about my brochure websites click

      <p>
        I have experience working with site auditing, SEO related projects and
        ecommerce solutions through my own professional job. I consult on
        ecommerce related projects where possible, and would never embark on a
        project that I felt I could not have a meaningful impact on. Please see
