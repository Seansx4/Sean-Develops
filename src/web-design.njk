      <p>
        As mentioned on the homepage, brochure websites are lightweight
        websites. They are ideal for providing local businesses with a web
        presence as they do not rely on complex data management systems in the
        way websites like Facebook or Amazon do. Instead brochure websites
        function to showcase a business - providing key information,
        testimonials and updates. Brochure websites play a vital role for local
        business who conduct their trade in person. A recent survey reported
        that

      <h3 class="feature__heading">No Website Builders</h3>
      <p>
        The majority of today's websites are built using website builders, such
        as WordPress. These tools are fantastic for large scale or complicated
        website projects, but due to their cost, I believe they are completely
        unnecessary for brochure websites. WordPress monthly subscriptions range
        from €8-25, meaning owners of a WordPress website pay at least €96 a
        year to simply own a website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web developers expense this cost to clients, passing it as the price to
        own a website, when in fact it is the price to own a website built using
        a building tool. Furthermore, this price is prior to paying for a custom
        domain registration or SSL security certificate, which may range between
        €30-120.

      <h3 class="feature__heading">SX4 Websites</h3>
      <p>
        At SX4 all brochure websites are custom coded from scratch. By forgoing
        the use of a website builder, the websites I create avoid a hefty montly
        subscription fee. Furthermore, by skipping the use of website builders,
        SX4 websites recieve a free SSL secuirty certificate. This means all SX4
        websites are HTTPS secure, as favoured by Google, free of charge. This
        saves customers €80-130 per year.
      </p>

      <p>
        SX4 websites follow the "mobile first" design principle. This ensures
        all websites are user friendly on mobile, tablet and desktop devices.
        While the websites may be similar in terms of structure, it is the
        design that sets them apart.

      <h3 class="feature__heading">My Approach</h3>
      <p>
        A common practice in web development is to carry out a design first
        approach with clients. From my experience, this approach leads to
        extended discussions over minor details, and typically favours
        developers who are paid by the hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach is unique in the manner that I fully create a website before
        reaching out to a business. This approach reduces an unnecessarily long
        design phase, saving both time and money. The main objective with a
        brochure website is to establish a web presence, and once this is
        achieved, design can then follow on a smaller scale.
